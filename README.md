# DappDjangoProject
Trying to develope a distributed webapp to securely store user's documents on the decentralized system using Django and IPFS file system.

Modules:
1. User authentication
2. File upload
3. File download
4. User Creation

IPFS: Will be used to store file in decentralized manner. A user will be able to view and upload new files to IPFS.

Encryption: Somekind of encryption will be used to securly share the files. 

Blockchain: The article below states that blockchain can be used to store hashes of file stored on IPFS. But not sure how to make it or how it works. (Needs to read more)
